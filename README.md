## Schema
The schema of GAPIC Showcase API can be found in [schema/google/showcase/v1beta1](schema/google/showcase/v1beta1)
It's dependencies can be found in the [schema/api-common-protos](schema/api-common-protos)
submodule.

## Quick Start
This quick start guide will show you how to start the server and make a request to it.

### Step 1. Run the server
Run the showcase server to allow requests to be sent to it. This opens port :7469 to
send and receive requests.

```sh
$ gapic-showcase run
> 2018/09/19 02:13:09 Showcase listening on port: :7469
```

### Step 2. Make a request
Open a new terminal window and make a request to the server.
```sh
$ gapic-showcase \
  identity \ # Service name
  create-user \ # Message name
  --user.display_name Rumble \ # Request fields
  --user.email rumble@goodboi.com
> name:"users/0" display_name:"Rumble" email:"rumble@goodboi.com" create_time:<seconds:1554414332 nanos:494679000 > update_time:<seconds:1554414332 nanos:494679000 >
```
_* You can make requests to this server from your own client but an insecure channel
must be used since the server does not implement auth._
